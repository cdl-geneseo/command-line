# 15. Review and Next Steps

## What we did

In this session, we learned:

- how to use `touch` and `echo` to create files
- how to use `mkdir` to create folders
- how to navigate our file structure by `cd`(change directory), `pwd` (print working directory), and `ls` (list)
- how to use redirects (`>`) and pipes (`|`) to create a pipeline
- how to remove files and folders using `rm` (remove) and `rm -r` (remove recursively)
- how to do some basic file editing from the command line using the programs Vim and Nano
- how to download content from the web to your machine using `curl`
- how to explore text files using word and line counts, `head` and `tail`, and the concatenate command `cat`
- how to search in text files using the `grep` command

And we made a cheat sheet for reference.

When we started, we reviewed what text is — whether plain or enriched. We learned that text editors that don't fix formatting of font, color, and size, do allow for more flexible manipulation and multi-program use. If text is allowed to be a string of characters (and not specific characters chosen for their compliance with a designer's intention), that text can be fed through programs and altered with automated regularity. Text editors are different software than Bash (or Terminal), which is a text-based shell that allows you to interact directly with your operating system giving direct input and receiving output.

## Some next steps you might want to take

*&hellip; not necessarily in this order:*

- Explore the resources at [Awesome Bash](https://github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash).
- Learn how to spiff up your command-line interface and add new capabilities to your shell by moving from bash to zsh and installing [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
- Explore Geneseo's LinkedIn Learning videos (via myGeneseo) on the terminal, the command-line, shell scripting, programming languages, and web development.
- Learn how to use [regular expressions](http://www.rexegg.com/) (aka "regex") in your command-line searches and inside the wide range of software applications that support it, then sharpen your regex skills or test your expressions using the interactive [regexr](https://regexr.com/). 
- Learn how to install additional programs that you can use on the command-line using a package manager such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for MacOS) or Apt (for Linux).
- Learn about Git (a versioning tool that was used to build this website and is most powerful when used from the command line) and GitHub (the cloud service that hosts this .website and that open-source developers use to collaborate on all sorts of projects, especially software)
- Learn to write plain text documents in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple syntax that's easily converted to a range of other formats, such as HTML or PDF and that's incredibly useful for, among other things, lightweight, portable note-taking.
- Learn about [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a super-useful command-line tool for converting files from one format to another (for example, Markdown to .docx, .pdf, or .epub).
