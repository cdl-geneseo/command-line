# 15. Review and Next Steps

Now is a good time to do a quick review!

In this session, we learned:

- how to use `touch` and `echo` to create files
- how to use `mkdir` to create folders
- how to navigate our file structure by `cd`(change directory), `pwd` (print working directory), and `ls` (list)
- how to use redirects (`>`) and pipes (`|`) to create a pipeline
- how to explore a comma separated values (`.csv`) dataset using word and line counts, `head` and `tail`, and the concatenate command `cat`
- how to search text files using the `grep` command

And we made a [cheat sheet](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=8) for reference!

When we started, we reviewed what text is—whether plain or enriched. We learned that text editors that don't fix formatting of font, color, and size, do allow for more flexible manipulation and multi-program use. If text is allowed to be a string of characters (and not specific characters chosen for their compliance with a designer's intention), that text can be fed through programs and altered with automated regularity. Text editors are different software than Bash (or Terminal), which is a text-based shell that allows you to interact directly with your operating system giving direct input and receiving output.
